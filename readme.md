## ⚙️ Setup & Installation  

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites  
- Java 8+ and Servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat)  
- MySQL or compatible database for user/bill data  
- Web browser to access the UI  

### 2️⃣ Deployment Steps  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dineshkumarsammeta/WebSite_for_Bill_Payment.git
   cd WebSite_for_Bill_Payment
Configure database connection in DBAccess.class (URL, username, password)

Build the project (e.g., using javac or an IDE)

Deploy the WAR or compiled files into your servlet container (e.g., Tomcat)

Access the portal at: http://localhost:8080/YourAppName/

3️⃣ Usage

Create a new user via the Sign-Up page

Sign in with valid credentials

Select your service region and tariff information

Proceed to payment after validation

🔒 Security & Best Practices

Passwords are hashed using a secure algorithm (see HashGenerator.class)

Input validation is applied in servlets to prevent injection or improper data access

Use of modular utilities (DBAccess.abclass) ensures secure database handling

Recommendation: Deploy in HTTPS mode and enable TLS for production

📊 Future Work & Enhancements

Implement online payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal)

Add transaction history dashboard for users

Mobile-responsive front end and API separation (REST services)

Logging and audit trail for every payment attempt

Multi-region tariff update system with admin interface
